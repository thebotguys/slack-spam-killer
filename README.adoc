*The truly misterious spam killer bot for slack teams.*

This slack bot provides a spam wiping feature from messages. It:

. Deletes messages which contain *blocked keywords*.
. Signals users which post those messages to allow admins to *deactivate* them, by posting to a specified channel.



== Setup
You can deploy with Heroku to have everything easily setup.
Another solution is to deploy it wherever you want and setup the environment variables properly.
See the doc for that (link:docs/environment.adoc[environment.adoc]).

=== Credits:
I really am thankful to *@jvaljean* from *cryptosurge.xyz* slack for inspiring me and giving
me a quick and dirty codebase to optimize, which for sure allowed this bot to be what it's now.
